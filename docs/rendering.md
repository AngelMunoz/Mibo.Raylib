# Rendering Overview

Mibo.Raylib uses a **deferred, layer-sorted rendering pipeline**. Instead of calling raylib draw functions directly, you build a list of commands each frame, and the renderer sorts and executes them in one pass.

## The Pipeline

1. Your view function builds `IRenderCommand2D` commands and adds them to a `RenderBuffer2D`
2. The renderer sorts commands by `Layer` (ascending)
3. The renderer executes commands in order
4. raylib auto-batches GPU draw calls; optional post-processing passes run after

## Why Deferred Rendering?

- **Separation of concerns**: Your view doesn't have to worry about draw order, batching, or GPU state.
- **Lighting**: Commands can be interleaved with light commands for 2D lighting (see [Lighting](graphics2d/overview.html#lighting)).
- **Post-processing**: Screen-space shader passes run after the scene is rendered.
- **Predictable ordering**: Every command declares its layer explicitly.

## 2D Rendering

The 2D pipeline is built on `Renderer2D<'Model>` in the `Mibo.Elmish.Graphics2D` namespace. See:

## 3D Rendering

The 3D pipeline is built on `Renderer3D<'Model>` in the `Mibo.Elmish.Graphics3D` namespace. It uses a pluggable `IRenderPipeline3D` that interprets `Command3D` values — draw meshes, billboards, lights, shadows, and post-processing passes.

- [Camera](camera.html) — `Camera3DConfig`, split-screen, overlay cameras

## Multi-Renderer Compositing

You can combine 2D and 3D renderers in the same program. The 3D scene renders first, then the 2D renderer composites on top (HUD, menus, debug overlays).

```fsharp
Program.mkProgram init update
|> Program.withRenderer (fun () ->
    Renderer3D.create pipeline view3D)
|> Program.withRenderer (fun () ->
    Renderer2D.create view2D)
```

The 2D renderer uses `Renderer2DConfig.noClear` to skip clearing the background, preserving the 3D scene underneath. Per-camera clear control is also available via `Camera3DConfig` and `Camera2DConfig`.

See also: [Camera](camera.html) for multi-camera patterns.
