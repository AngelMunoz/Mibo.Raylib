/// Interface for a pluggable 3D rendering pipeline.
/// Owns how to turn a sorted buffer into pixels: pass order, shadow maps, lighting math, post-process.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The pipeline is the consumer of geometry, not the definer. It receives a buffer of
/// <see cref="T:Mibo.Elmish.Graphics3D.IRenderCommand3D"/> and interprets them.
///
/// The built-in <see cref="T:Mibo.Elmish.Graphics3D.Pipelines.ClusteredForwardPipeline"/>
/// is the reference implementation, not the engine core. Users may swap it for a deferred,
/// SDF, or visibility-buffer pipeline without changing their view functions.
